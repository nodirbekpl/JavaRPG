# JavaRPG

A console-based RPG built in Java to practice core game development concepts
without using a game engine.

## Features
- Turn-based combat system
- Multiple enemies (Goblin, Orc, Skeleton)
- Player skills with cooldowns
- Enemy states (stun)
- Scalable combat logic
- Clean Git history

## Commands
- `attack` — basic attack
- `power` — strong attack with cooldown
- `stun` — chance to stun the enemy
- `heal` — restore health
- `status` — show current stats
- `help` — list available commands
- `quit` — exit the game

## Purpose
This project focuses on:
- Game loop design
- State management
- Turn-based mechanics
- Clean code structure
- Gradual evolution toward full game systems

No graphics. No engine. Logic first.

## Future Plans
- Enemy targeting selection
- Status effects (poison, burn)
- Skill expansion
- Refactoring combat into dedicated classes
- Transition to graphical engines later
